# Mapping Files

## Overview

Mapping files are core to the functionality of Rodeo. These YAML based files represent the data fields and the schema in which the data will be entered into the graph. A mapping file consists of four required top-level keys: name, fields, nodes, and relationships. Additionally, there are two optional top-level keys, version and plugins. An example mapping file can be found in the templates directory of the distribution.
